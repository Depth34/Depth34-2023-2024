# 2024-WPCPUR-ROV

## Hello there! 
If you are reading this and you do not belong to the Payton Underwater Robotics Team... bollocks.
If you DO belong to the Payton Underwater Robotics Team, then hooray! You made it! Welcome to the Depth 34 robotics team GitHub, where you can find... stuff and things... :D


We have a discord at {I cannot permalink as of now because permissions are weird}

We also have an additional repository at https://github.com/TheClockworkDungeouneer/underwater-controller
It is gross and complicated because I (Max Wanger) coded it with very little time and in C++, which I suck at. If someone wants to help with it, it would be appreciated and I appologise in advance.
I would like to get us going with the joystick controls and driving simulation, but I need to improve (or find someone better at) working with vectors (for the joystick postion) and OpenGL for not horrible 3D graphics
Look up a video game tutorial to learn SLD2 and if you are interested! (Again the 3D graphics will be done in OpenGL though!)


## Conclusion

Thanks for reading this rambling, we will work on getting more documentation as we have it. If anyone would like to submit documentation or correct my spelling mistakes from writing this in vim:
- sent it to me via discord (@a\_sand\_of\_peicy\_ham) 
- or email me at mwanger@cps.edu (I might not see it though).

Things are pretty unprofessional now, but we are working on improving it. We await your feedback and any help you can offer throughout the process. 
Just like you, we are all human (except Piotr, I think he's a robot) so again, communication is vital to us, as well as finding volunteers to mentor through becoming an apprentice to a team captian.
